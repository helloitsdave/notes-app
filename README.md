[![CodeQL](https://github.com/helloitsdave/notes-app/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/helloitsdave/notes-app/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

The intention is to build and deploy a very simple app (FE/BE + DB) which can be used to demonstrate tests for each layer using vitest, supertest, react-testing-library and playwright.

Starting point for building the app was the great FreeCodeCamp tutorial [Full Stack Project Tutorial â€“ Create A Notes App Using React and Node.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/full-stack-project-tutorial-create-a-notes-app-using-react-and-node-js/)

Refactored the app for testability and added a few additional tweaks.

## Deployed app

- FE and BE services are deployed using the free tier on [render.com](https://render.com/)
- Database is deployed using serverless postgres on [neon](https://neon.tech/)
